We discussed refactoring a .NET application that transcribes speech to text using Google Cloud Speech API. We abstracted the transcription provider using an ITranscriptionProvider interface and created a GoogleTranscriptionProvider class. Additionally, we created an IRecorder interface for handling recording states, display, and file management. We then updated the Worker class to utilize dependency injection for the ITranscriptionProvider and IRecorder implementations. This refactoring enables the possibility to implement an OpenAiTranscriptionProvider to use OpenAI's Whisper ASR API in the future.
